# Insanity
Although in the sanity category, this belongs in the insanity category, this is a challenge that tests upon the persistence of the challenger, having to decode and decode again.

Setup is as simple as running `./create.py GCTF{FLAG_HERE}` and retrieving the `flag.txt` file. Additionally, difficulty as well as time taken can be tweaked through the `DIFFICULTY` settings, if you feel particularly evil.

## Challenge Text
