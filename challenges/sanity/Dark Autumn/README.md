# Dark Autumn

## Question Text

We've just trained our Discord moderator-bot to understand the seasons of the year. Since it's currently autumn, perhaps you can ask our bot to shed some light on it? Type `!help` within our Discord server to get the help menu from moderator-bot.

## Setup Guide
1. Discord RedBot
    * Set up a RedBot (https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot)
    * Transfer "seasons.py" into the "cogs" folder.
    * Let bot join server.
    * `!load seasons` (replace '!' with your RedBot's prefix)
2. Dark Web Website
    * (Optional) Vanity gen the domain name with scallion (https://github.com/lachesis/scallion) and copy out private key
    * Register for a free dark web hosting account (Daniel's Hosting) (http://dhosting4okcs22v.onion) along with the private key
    * FTP into the server they provided you and transfer "index.html" into it
